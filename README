A C++ SDL/OpenGL/FMOD?/Box2D? Framework
Started by Luka Horvat (redreaper132(at)gmail.com)
Framework start date: April 2011

Currently works on Windows/Linux.

-----FILES-----
Luka.h -> framework header file
Luka.cpp -> framework file
Main.cpp -> main game loop for testing the framework

-----TODO-----

->Global:
	-Add FMOD EX to initialization ( I only know the old FMOD 3 )
	-Add a loading function for sounds and music if needed
	-Make better sprite rendering function (2D sprites)
	-Ask people what to add -> profit? :D
	-Add Box2D?!?

->Up next:
	-Add setup functions for classed, so they can be set after 
construciton	
	

-----CHANGELOG-----
-->20.11.2011<--
+Comments

-->8.9.2011<--
+Fixed calculateAngle function, works now

-->4.7.2011<--
+Added loadImage function to Image class, so that you don't have to load images when constructing

-->29.6.2011<--
+Added Image class
+Image class loads image
+Changed the rect class so that you can bind an image to it, a rect with an binded image to it will always be textured
NOTE: Image class is still MUCH WORK IN PROGRESS, it's super simple for now and only works with normal rects

-->9.6.2011<--
+FTGL library added, set #define FONT to 0 in "Luka.h" if you don't want to use it
+Change in scaleScreen()
+Added testing for VisualStudio (isn't tested yet)
+renderText() function for rendering text using a pre-loaded font. Even if the functions has a size parameter, it's recommended that you use 1 font for 1 size because changing the font size every frame drops the framerate below 30
+Temporary FPS display

-->3.6.2011<--
+Added rendering functions for rect,rotRect and Point
+Added border rendering functions
+getRect() function for RotRect
+rotate() function for Rect (that way the angle is normalized)
+Render rotation for rect and screen, also scaleScreen funciton
+Color structure

-->26.5.2011<--
+calculateSpeed() function change type from float to void

-->23.5.2011<--
+Added collision detection for rotated rectangles
+Small fix in angles

-->2.5.2011<--
+Moved function definitions to Luka.cpp

-->27.4.2011<--
+Removed gfx namespace, everything is now under frm namespace
+Added point and rotatabel rectangle stuctures
+Added different consturctors for sturctures
-Canceled the line sturcture, not really needed now, will add them later
+Minor changes in older code
+Rotation and movement now works for rotatabel rectangles 

-->17.4.2011<--
+Initialization (size of window, fullscreen)
+Normal rectangle collision detection
+Angle calculation function for 2 Box-es
+X and Y speed calculation function for a given angle
+Loading texture function (using SDL_image)
+Rendering a frame from sprite function (works only on 1D sprites- for now)
+Box structure
+Event are now globalized ( frm::event )
+Functions for dinamic FPS -> setFPS(), getFPS(). delayFPS() -> is for caping at 60 FPS
